BASED ON A NEARBY USGS MONITORING STATION, THE AREA WHERE THE FAILURE OCCURRED CREEPS AT A RATE OF ABOUT 5 MM/YEAR. THE PIPE RUPTURED AT A PARTIAL PENETRATION GIRTH WELD. THE ORIENTATION OF THE PIPE RELATIVE TO THE FAULT AND THE SENSE OF MOVEMENT ON THE FAULT CAUSES THE PIPE TO BE LOADED IN EXTENSION, WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE SEPARATION OF THE PIPE THAT WAS OBSERVED AT THE BREAK. GIVEN THAT NO OTHER BREAKS OCCURRED WHERE DISTRIBUTION MAINS IN THE AREA INTERSECT THE HAYWARD FAULT, PG&E CONCLUDES THAT THE BREAK WAS DUE TO A COMBINATION OF HEAVY RAIN FALL AND LONG-TERM CREEP LOADING. A DETAILED ASSESSMENT OF HISTORICAL LEAKS IN THE AREA DID NOT SHOW A CORRELATION BETWEEN LEAKS IN THE AREA AND THE HAYWARD FAULT.      NO MEDIA WAS REPORTED ONSITE. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT AND POLICE WERE ONSITE. NO FATALITIES OR INJURIES WERE REPORTED. THREE HOMES WERE EVACUATED, AND GAS SERVICE WAS INTERRUPTED FOR EIGHT CUSTOMERS AS PART OF THE ISOLATION STRATEGY.

THE SERVICE LINE HELD THE PRESSURE TEST WITHOUT THE RISER.  THE HOMEOWNER'S RISER WAS REMOVED AND SENT TO AN INDEPENDENT LABORATORY PLANNED FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION (PLANNED FOR APRIL 21, 2022). THIS RISER WAS INSTALLED BY THE HOMEOWNER OR THE HOMEOWNER'S CONTRACTOR OR REPRESENTATIVE, NOT BY THE NATIONAL GAS & OIL COOPERATIVE.    THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE EXPLOSION WAS DUE TO A PULLED RISER. A TREE ROOT APPROXIMATELY 6 FEET AWAY FROM THE BEND IN THE RISER GREW ACROSS THE SERVICE LINE. OVER TIME, THE ROOT PULLED THE SERVICE LINE MOST OF THE WAY OUT OF THE RISER CONNECTION, CAUSING A LEAK.

DUE TO LONG TERM, HEAVY RAINS THAT OCCURRED OVER A PERIOD OF SEVERAL DAYS PRIOR TO THIS INCIDENT, THE SATURATED SOIL CREATED A HEAVY OVERBURDEN ON THE INLET PIPING, AND THAT STRAIN CAUSED THE STEEL PORTION OF THAT PIPING TO SEPARATE AT THE COUPLER. THE FIRST RESPONDERS ON SITE DETERMINED TO SHUT THE SYSTEM DOWN FOR SAFETY, MAKE REPAIRS AND RESTORE SERVICE. PERMANENT REPAIRS RENEWED THAT COUPLED PIPE, REPLACING IT WITH ALL WELDED STEEL PIPING.    NRC FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS:  GIVEN THAT THIS WAS A RELATIVELY NEW INSTALLATION (2018), IS IT POSSIBLE THERE WERE SOME WORKMANSHIP ISSUES THAT MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE FAILURE?  WAS THE PIPING INSTALLED IN A BIND?  HOW FAR DID IT SEPARATE WHEN IT PULLED APART?  WERE THE CONSTRUCTION SPECIFICATIONS ADHERED TO?    PEOPLES FOLLOW UP ANSWERS:  AN INTERNAL INVESTIGATION WAS CONDUCTED AFTER THIS INCIDENT OCCURRED AND NO POOR WORKMANSHIP ISSUES WERE FOUND THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THIS INCIDENT, WITH ALL CONSTRUCTION SPECIFICATIONS BEING ADHERED TO.  AT THE TIME THAT THIS INCIDENT OCCURRED, THE PIPING HAD SEPARATED APPROXIMATELY 3 INCHES AND SHOWED NO SIGNS OF MISALIGNMENT AND WAS STILL IN LINE WITH THE INLET RISER IT HAD SEPARATED FROM, INDICATING THAT THE PIPE WAS NOT INSTALLED IN A BIND.   THE NUTS ON THE COUPLING BOLTS WERE FOUND IN THE POSITION OF HAVING BEEN TIGHTENED WELL INTO THE FINAL TORQUED TIGHTENED PHASE.

THE RESPONDING GAS SERVICE WORKER (GSW) PERFORMED A SERIES OF LEAK TEST AT 10223 DODGE RD., INCLUDING BAR HOLE TESTING THE SERVICE LINE AND THE MAIN.  NO  GAS READS WERE DETECTED AT THIS LOCATION.     THE GSW PROCEEDED TO CHECK FOR GAS READINGS ALONG THE SERVICE LINE AS WELL AS THE BUILDING PERIMETER (DOORS AND WINDOWS) AT 10218 DODGE RD. USING A SENSIT GOLD CGI COMBUSTIBLE GAS INDICATOR.  NO READS WERE DETECTED DURING THIS PORTION OF THE INVESTIGATION.    THE GSW EXPANDED THE LEAK INVESTIGATION TO THE LIGHTNING STRIKE LOCATION AT 10209 DODGE RD., AND FOUND 100% GAS READS AT THE EDGE OF PAVEMENT ON BOTH SIDES OF DODGE ROAD AS WELL AS WATER BUBBLING FROM A CRACK IN THE PAVEMENT NEAR THE CENTER OF THE ROAD ABOVE THE SERVICE LINE.

THE PROPERTY WAS UNOCCUPIED AND NO INJURIES OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE INCIDENT.     AFTER THE INCIDENT, CONSUMERS ENERGY CONDUCTED BAR HOLE TESTING IN THE VICINITY OF 10218 DODGE ROAD.   THIS TESTING INDICATED THAT GAS HAD MIGRATED FROM THE LEAK LOCATION AT 10209 DODGE ROAD ALONG THE MAIN TO A LOCATION APPROXIMATELY 20' WEST OF THE IDENTIFIED LEAK.   THE HIGHEST SUSTAINED READS WERE OBTAINED APPROXIMATELY 20 FEET FROM THE LEAK LOCATION AND APPROXIMATELY 60 FEET FROM THE BUILDING WALL.  THE INITIAL READ TAKEN AT 16:00, APPROXIMATELY 3.5 HOURS AFTER THE EXPLOSION WAS 55%.  A READ TAKEN AT THE SAME LOCATION 2 HOURS LATER (22%) INDICATES THE MIGRATING GAS WAS VENTING AT THIS LOCATION.  THIS LOCATION WAS MONITORED THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS AND CONTINUED TO VENT. LOWER RESIDUAL GAS READINGS WERE ALSO OBTAINED, BUT AT NO TIME (PRE OR POST-INCIDENT) WERE THERE ANY GAS READINGS AT THE BUILDING WALL OF 10218 DODGE ROAD.      BASED ON THE INCIDENT INVESTIGATION SUMMARIZE ABOVE AND OUR INABILITY TO PERFORM AN INVESTIGATION OF THE CUSTOMER'S FUEL LINE AND GAS APPLIANCE(S), CONSUMERS ENERGY FOUND NO CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE THAT THE EXPLOSION AND FIRE AT 10218 DODGE RD., WAS THE RESULT OF A RELEASE  AND/OR MIGRATION OF CONSUMERS ENERGY'S JURISDICTIONAL GAS."

AT 09:34, GERC CONFIRMED WITH NEW YORK CITY FIRE DEPARTMENT (FDNY) A SCANNER REPORT OF AN EXPLOSION AND BUILDING COLLAPSE AT E. 114TH ST. AND PARK AVENUE (THE E. 114TH ST. LOCATION WAS INCORRECT).  AT 09:38, THE GDS MECHANIC ENROUTE TO 1652 PARK AVENUE REPORTED OBSERVING SMOKE, FLAMES, AND HEAVY ACTIVITY ON PARK AVENUE SOUTH OF E. 119TH STREET.  GERC DISPATCHED ADDITIONAL CON EDISON PERSONNEL TO THE LOCATION AT APPROXIMATELY 09:38.  CON EDISON PERSONNEL FIRST ARRIVED AT THE LOCATION AT 09:40 AND CONFIRMED THE EXPLOSION AND COLLAPSE OF TWO BUILDINGS ON PARK AVENUE BETWEEN E. 116TH ST. AND E. 117TH ST.    NUMEROUS CON EDISON PERSONNEL, INCLUDING GDS MECHANICS, CONSTRUCTION CREWS, SUPERVISORS, PLANNERS, AND MANAGERS RESPONDED TO THE SCENE OF THE BUILDING COLLAPSE.  CON EDISON PERSONNEL CONDUCTED AN INVESTIGATION FOR GAS MIGRATION THAT INCLUDED ADJACENT BUILDINGS AND ACCESSIBLE SUBSURFACE STRUCTURES IN THE AREA.  CON EDISON PERSONNEL IDENTIFIED THREE (3) FIRE BANK LOCATIONS FOR EXCAVATION TO STOP THE FLOW OF GAS ON THE WEST SIDE OF PARK AVENUE BETWEEN E 116TH ST AND E 117TH ST.  AT APPROXIMATELY 13:44, A STREET COLLAPSE AND AN APPARENT WATER MAIN BREAK WERE OBSERVED IN THE ROADWAY IN FRONT OF 1644 AND 1646 PARK AVENUE.  AT THE TIME OF THE STREET COLLAPSE, THERE WAS A STRONG ODOR OF GAS IN THE AREA.    FIRE BANK EXCAVATIONS WERE COMPLETED AND STOPPERS WERE INSTALLED TO ISOLATE THE GAS SUPPLY TO THE AFFECTED AREA AT APPROXIMATELY 13:44, AND THE ODOR OF GAS DISSIPATED.  THE 8"" LOW PRESSURE POLYETHYLENE / 8"" LOW PRESSURE CAST IRON MAIN SUPPLYING (7) SERVICES ON THE WEST SIDE OF PARK AVENUE AND ON THE NORTH SIDE OF E. 116TH ST., BETWEEN PARK AVENUE AND MADISON AVENUE, WERE ISOLATED.    INVESTIGATION:    FOLLOWING THE ACCIDENT, THE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD (NTSB) TOOK CONTROL OF THE INCIDENT SITE AND BEGAN ITS INVESTIGATION. THE CITY OF NEW YORK, THE NEW YORK STATE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION, THE PIPELINE AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS SAFETY ADMINISTRATION, CONSOLIDATED EDISON COMPANY OF NEW YORK, AND GEORG FISCHER CENTRAL PLASTIC WERE PARTIES TO THE INVESTIGATION. DURING THE COURSE OF THE NTSB INVESTIGATION, CON EDISON PROVIDED A PARTY SUBMISSION DESCRIBING THE PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT AS A BREACH IN THE SEWER SYSTEM WHICH CAUSED SOIL EROSION AFFECTING SUBSURFACE UTILITIES, INCLUDING A CAST IRON WATER MAIN AND HDPE GAS FACILITIES, AND LIKELY RESULTED IN AN IMPACT BY FALLING ROADWAY PAVEMENT WHICH CRACKED THE SERVICE TEE TO 1642 PARK AVENUE. IN ITS ACCIDENT REPORT ADOPTED ON JUNE 9, 2015, THE NTSB DETERMINED THAT THE PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT WAS (1) THE FAILURE OF THE DEFECTIVE FUSION JOINT AT THE SERVICE TEE, INSTALLED BY CONSOLIDATED EDISON COMPANY OF NEW YORK, INC., IN 2011, THAT ALLOWED NATURAL GAS TO LEAK FROM THE GAS MAIN AND MIGRATE INTO THE BUILDING WHERE IT IGNITED AND (2) A BREACH IN THE SEWER LINE THAT WENT UNREPAIRED BY THE NEW YORK CITY DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION SINCE AT LEAST 2006 THAT ALLOWED GROUNDWATER AND SOIL TO FLOW INTO THE SEWER, RESULTING IN A LOSS OF SUPPORT FOR THE GAS MAIN, WHICH CAUSED THE LINE TO SAG AND OVERSTRESSED THE DEFECTIVE FUSION JOINT."

BANCROFT STREET.  AN FSD TECHNICIAN WAS DISPATCHED TO INVESTIGATE THIS LEAK.  HE ARRIVED ON LOCATION AT 17:29 AND BEGAN HIS INVESTIGATION.  A READING OF 70% LEL AT THE FRONT FOUNDATION WALL TO 1845 S. BANCROFT WAS REPORTED BY THE TECHNICIAN TO THE FSD DISPATCHER.  BASED ON THIS REPORT, A DISTRIBUTION CREW WAS DISPATCHED AT 18:10.  FSD AND DISTRIBUTION SUPERVISION WERE ALSO DISPATCHED TO THE LOCATION.  THE CREW ARRIVED ON LOCATION AT 18:24 AND IMMEDIATELY BEGAN THEIR INVESTIGATION.  DURING THE COURSE OF THE INVESTIGATION AND WHILE THE DISTRIBUTION FOREMAN AND THE FSD TECHNICIAN WERE INSIDE THE PROPERTY AT 1849 S. BANCROFT CHECKING FOR GAS READINGS, AN EXPLOSION TOOK PLACE AT APPROXIMATELY 19:05 INSIDE 1849 S. BANCROFT.  THE EXPLOSION SEVERELY DAMAGED THE TWO RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS AT 1849 AND 1847 S. BANCROFT.  IT ALSO INJURED BOTH PGW EMPLOYEES WHO WERE INSIDE THE HOUSE, AS WELL AS ONE HOMEOWNER.  THE INJURIES SUSTAINED BY ALL THREE INDIVIDUALS WERE NON-LIFE THREATENING.  BOTH THE DISTRIBUTION FOREMAN AND HOMEOWNER WERE TAKEN TO A LOCAL HOSPITAL FOR TREATMENT AND RELEASED ON THE SAME DAY WHILE THE FSD TECHNICIAN WAS ADMITTED WITH BURNS TO HIS NECK AND LOWER TORSO.  THE EXPLOSION AT THE SCENE WAS OBSERVED BY A FSD SUPERVISOR WHO HAD JUST ARRIVED ON THE SCENE AT 19:05.  PHILADELPHIA FIRE DEPARTMENT, PHILADELPHIA POLICE DEPARTMENT AND PECO ENERGY WERE CALLED IN FOR ASSISTANCE, IN ADDITION TO VARIOUS PGW RESOURCES SUCH AS, DISTRIBUTION CREWS, FSD TECHNICIANS, MOBILE EQUIPMENT, GREASE TRUCK, SUPERVISORY PERSONNEL, CHEMICAL SERVICES, ETC.  THE PAPUC WAS ALSO NOTIFIED OF THE INCIDENT.    THE GAS MAIN IN THE EAST FOOTWAY IN FRONT OF 1849 S. BANCROFT (4"" 1939 LOW PRESSURE CAST IRON MAIN) WAS GREASED OFF THROUGH A PLASTIC SERVICE TO 1843 S. BANCROFT AT 19:51 AND THE LEAK CONSEQUENTLY WAS MADE SAFE.  AS A RESULT OF THE GREASING OFF, A TOTAL OF FOUR (4) PROPERTIES WERE TEMPORARILY OUT OF GAS.  PECO ALSO SHUT OFF THE ELECTRIC POWER TO 1849 S. BANCROFT AT 21:00.  AFTER MAKING THE JOB SAFE AND RECEIVING THE GO AHEAD FROM PFD, PGW PERSONNEL ON THE SCENE CONTINUED WITH THE INVESTIGATION.  EVERY BUILDING ON THE 1800 BLOCK OF S. BANCROFT WAS CHECKED FOR GAS READINGS.  ALSO, THE 4"" CAST IRON MAIN ON THE BLOCK ALONG WITH ALL ACTIVE GAS SERVICES WERE BAR HOLED IN ORDER TO CHECK FOR ANY POSSIBLE LEAKS.  DURING THIS BLOCK CHECK THE CREW PICKED UP LEL READINGS IN FRONT OF 1835 AND 1816/1818.  A BROKEN MAIN WAS EVENTUALLY FOUND AND REPAIRED IN FRONT OF 1818 AND A TOTAL OF SIX (6) SERVICES ON THE BLOCK WERE RENEWED WITH PLASTIC.  THE GREASED 4"" MAIN WAS ALSO CUT AND CAPPED AT 03:45.  THIS PORTION OF THE 4"" MAIN THAT WAS CUT AND CAPPED (100') WAS AIR TESTED AT 6"" WC AND THE TEST FAILED.  THIS SECTION OF THE MAIN WAS THEN EXCAVATED COMPLETELY AND A BROKEN MAIN WAS FOUND IN FRONT OF 1849.  AN 8' SECTION OF THE PIPE, CONTAINING THE BROKEN MAIN, WAS CUT AND REMOVED FROM THE EXCAVATION, TAGGED AS EVIDENCE AND TRANSPORTED TO THE PGW EVIDENCE ROOM ON 1/31/2014.  IT IS BELIEVED FROST HEAVE WAS THE CAUSE OF THE BROKEN MAIN, FOURTEEN INCHES OF FROST WAS MEASURED AT THIS LOCATION. THE SERVICES TO 1845 AND 1847 (BOTH 1 1/4"" UNPROTECTED STEEL SERVICES) WERE ALSO AIR TESTED AND FAILED.  AFTER THE INVESTIGATION WAS COMPLETED, THE GAS SERVICE WAS RESTORED TO THE PROPERTIES THAT WERE SHUT OFF DURING THE GREASE OFF PROCESS.  THE BUILDING AT 1849 WAS DEMOLISHED ON 2/1/2014. PGW SUBSEQUENTLY REPLACED THE 4"" CAST IRON MAIN.    ANALYSIS OF THE INCIDENT PIPE SHOWED THAT IT NEVER COMPLETELY FRACTURED CIRCUMFERENTIALLY AND THE CRACK WAS CONSIDERED TIGHT WITH NO LARGE GAP BETWEEN THE MATING SURFACES.

FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS AT SCENE.  HOUSE WAS IN FLAMES AND FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS USING HOSES TO CONTROL FIRE.  WHEN IT WAS SAFE, CREW APPROACHED OUTSIDE RISER TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT WAS BROKEN ABOVE OR BELOW THE SHUT OFF VALVE.  THE ENTIRE METER ASSEMBLY WAS BURIED WITH SNOW, ICE AND ASH WHEN THEY APPROACHED.  07:45 GAS WAS SHUT OFF AT RISER USING A LONG HANDLED VALVE KEY.  THIS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE FLAMES HOWEVER DID NOT STOP THE FIRE.  IT WAS DETERMINED THAT GAS WAS LEAKING BY SHUTOFF ON RISER.  07:50 SERVICE DEPARTMENT BEGAN WALL CHECKS AT ALL THE NEIGHBORING HOUSES.  ALL WALL CHECKS WERE CLEAR.  08:00 GAS CREW BEGAN DIGGING SERVICE AT MAIN TO SHUT OFF GAS.  08:42 GAS SERVICE WAS SHUT OFF AT TEE.  UPON SHUT DOWN, FIRE IMMEDIATELY EXTINGUISHED.    FOLLOW-UP INVESTIGATION:    IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THIS INCIDENT THE SUBSEQUENT ACTION WAS TAKEN:    - A GAS SAMPLE WAS TAKEN AT THE NEIGHBORING HOUSE (501 CAYUGA ST) TO CHECK MERCAPTIN LEVELS.  TWO TESTS WERE COMPLETED USING BACKARACH ODOROMETER (ID# AIS367).  THE RESULTS WERE:  - .15 (TESTED BY ANDY HECKATHORN)  - .25 (TESTED PHILIP NATOLI)  - ABOVE GROUND SERVICE PIPING, INCLUDING CUSTOMER FUEL LINE, WAS INSPECTED FOR DAMAGE.  THE ENTIRE METER ASSEMBLY WAS SIGNIFICANTLY BENT FORWARD.  THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE TO THE REGULATOR, AND METER DUE TO THE FIRE.  CUSTOMER FUEL LINE WAS VERY LOOSE BUT STILL INTACT.  A CRACK WAS FOUND ON THE NIPPLE BETWEEN THE REDUCER AND THE BOTTOM OF THE SHUT OFF VALVE.  - SERVICE RISER WAS CAPPED, AND LINE WAS RE-ENERGIZED.  AN UNDERGROUND LEAK SURVEY WAS COMPLETED USING TWO CALIBRATED COMBUSTIBLE GAS INDICATORS (ID #052010 AND #052010).  ZERO GAS READINGS WERE FOUND.  - THE SERVICE LINE WAS PRESSURE TESTED WITH AIR AT 22PSI FOR 15 MINUTES, WITH NO DROP IN LINE PRESSURE.  - AFTER TESTING WAS COMPLETED, THE SERVICE LINE WAS PERMANENTLY RETIRED AT THE MAIN.  - JIM CLARY FROM THE NG CLAIMS DEPARTMENT AS WELL AS DENNIS WARE FROM WARE INVESTIGATIONS ARRIVED TO INVESTIGATE AND DOCUMENT THE EVENT.    PRELIMINARY REPORT:    CONSENSUS WITH THE LOCAL FIRE AND POLICE INVESTIGATORS AS WELL AS NG PERSONNEL DETERMINED THAT ICE AND SNOW SHED FROM THE ROOF OF THE RESIDENCE CAUSED THE DAMAGE TO THE SERVICE PIPING RESULTING IN THE LEAK.  THE MOST LIKELY IGNITION SOURCE OCCURRED FROM THE FURNACE WHICH WAS LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 5 FEET FROM THE SERVICE RISER."
