- flood ; flash flood, 
- windstrome
- extreme temperature 
-wildfire
- prolonged heatwaves 
-landslide
- sea level rise 
Critical Infrastructure 
- Transport, Energy, utilities network
Eveything is interconnected to multiple things 
rapid and accurate assessment of XXX

planning, maintenance, operation 
preparedness and adaptions for individual hazard at asset level benefit assest and infro system.

low probability and high consequenc event - tohoku earthquake and tsunami

Approach 
- holistics 
- crosss-sector approach 
- cost - benefit analysis for adopting 
- automate decision making 
- user can get information, means to communicte, interact.
- fast network
- resilience analytics - descriptive, predictive and presriptive modelling 
- data collection - temperature variation, ice accumulation, wind loading related 
- Wireless communication in case of emergency. 
- threshold - automated performance indicator 
- image and video inspection of critical infrastructure
- monitor reading from sensor, fiber optic strain and temperature, photogrammetry to generate point cloud. 
- data dashboard and visualization. 
- infrastrucure life cycle. 
- US and Europe Green deal by 2050
- accelerate ongoing effort 
phase 
1. planning and preparation - aging and assest deterioration. why it happening climate change role? AI virtual model; automate the identification of deterioration and damages
- Early warning - predicting damage in infrastructure from natural and
climatic hazards by fusing data and accurate measurements into model updating toward improved simulations

Phase B 2. aborption and response during and immediately 
3. Recovery




Challenges 
- complex interdenpendencies 
- government failed to adopt resilience plan design. 
- No data to make accurate infrastructure resilience predictions. 
- physical risk and damage from natural disaster.
