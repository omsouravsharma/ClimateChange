Ability to absorb and recover from disaster
effect on infrastructure due to climate change
- flood ; flash flood, 
- windstrome
- extreme temperature 
-wildfire
- prolonged heatwaves 
-landslide
- sea level rise 
Critical Infrastructure 
- Transport, Energy, utilities network
Eveything is interconnected to multiple things 
rapid and accurate assessment of XXX

planning, maintenance, operation 
preparedness and adaptions for individual hazard at asset level benefit assest and infro system.

-overly prioritise system efficiency over resilience. 

- data driven method and tools for quantifying resilience. 

- decoupling unnecessary dependencies accross infrastructure. 
link nodes 

- reduce redunandacy in system 

- economic, social and environment goals. 


low probability and high consequenc event - tohoku earthquake and tsunami

Approach 
- holistics 
- crosss-sector approach 
- cost - benefit analysis for adopting 
- automate decision making 
- user can get information, means to communicte, interact.
- fast network
- resilience analytics - descriptive, predictive and presriptive modelling 
- data collection - temperature variation, ice accumulation, wind loading related 
- Wireless communication in case of emergency. 
- threshold - automated performance indicator 
- image and video inspection of critical infrastructure
- monitor reading from sensor, fiber optic strain and temperature, photogrammetry to generate point cloud. 
- data dashboard and visualization. 
- infrastrucure life cycle. 
- US and Europe Green deal by 2050
- accelerate ongoing effort 
phase 
1. planning and preparation - aging and assest deterioration. why it happening climate change role? AI virtual model; automate the identification of deterioration and damages
- Early warning - predicting damage in infrastructure from natural and
climatic hazards by fusing data and accurate measurements into model updating toward improved simulations
-warning system 
-rapid response 
-decision making 
- smart tagging of infra 5G 


Phase B 2. aborption and response during and immediately 
- mobile phone as data - condition post 

3. Recovery
- what is available 
- rapid decision making 
- micro-grid reconfiguration
- real automated diagonsis

4 Phase D
evaluate deteriotaion 
restoration scenarios 
self-aware asset
- reducing waste generated in constructuion and the carbon footprint 




Challenges 
- complex interdenpendencies 
- government failed to adopt resilience plan design. 
- No data to make accurate infrastructure resilience predictions. 
- physical risk and damage from natural disaster. 
- cyber attack - Die Hard movie 
- privacy and risk misofrmation 
- adaption might be slow but there is way smartphone
- Identification of assest based on safety, cost, resiliency, infrastructure have greater environment impact. 
- complex interdependencies 

KPI
- Capacity 
- Operation and Maintenance
- Condition 
- Public Safety
- Funding 
- Resilience 
- Future Needs 
- Innovation

Recommendation 
- use tech
- enhancing natural or green infra
- system of system
- use of code and standard
- smarter infrastrue 
- increase pro-active steps in flood prone area.
- Design smart infratructure 
- Investig in resilient infra - sava money how?
- green roof 
- recommend generation matrix
- condiuct study what if it fail - impact
local or regional impact
- interconnected
